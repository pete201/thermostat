	  Blink the blue LED on the ESP-01 module
	  This example code is in the public domain
	
	  The blue LED on the ESP-01 module is connected to GPIO1
	  (which is also the TXD pin; so we cannot use Serial.print() at the same time)
	
	  Note that this sketch uses LED_BUILTIN to find the pin with the internal LED

	  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);     // Initialize the LED_BUILTIN pin as an output
      Serial.println();
      Serial.println("end of setup");

	  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);  // Turn the LED off by making the voltage HIGH
